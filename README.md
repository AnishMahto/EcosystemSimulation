# EcosystemSimulation
Inspired by Conway's Game of Life

Probably the largest single program I've made so far (700 lines, give or take)

Originally created for use as a small science fair project. It just takes the following ecosystem and simulates it over generations (you can choose how many ecosystems to generate at a time, or enter 0 to end program. Can generate roughly 15 generations in one shot before lagging). 

Ecosystem: grass, grasshopper, rabbit, mouse, snake, kookaburra, eagle

The initial generation is based off of random numbers, so you will get a different population every time you open up the program. The basis of whether an animal survives, dies, and/or how many it can reproduce is set with values. 

Keep in mind I had no intention of making an efficient program, as this was just for fun :)
